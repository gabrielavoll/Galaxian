Galaxian Replica
==============

This is a Processing 3 project converted into a Processing 2 project,
for web portability.

Compatible in both Javascript Modes only in Processing2

to play, visit: https://gato333.github.io/Galaxian/


## Notes

This was the best way to host the game outside of Processing's sharing site,
https://www.openprocessing.org/

Attempted to utilize a bare bones rails app on heroku to serve the game, didnt work

Also attmepted to serve the game on a bare bones nodejs app on heroku, which worked but, made the game itself very glitchy.

This iteration is super simple, an basic php app, with just a index.html page (with a tiny amount of javascript) and just a small style sheet
